# OpenAI-Projects

#### This repository contains two projects that use the OpenAI API:
* A chat bot project
* A PDF reader project

## Chat Bot Project
The chat bot project is a simple implementation of a conversational AI using the OpenAI API. It uses intent classification and entity resolution to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses.

To run the chat bot, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the chat_bot directory.
* Install the necessary dependencies, They are available in the first cell of each notebook.
* Open the chat_bot.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
* Run the notebook.

## PDF Reader Project
The PDF reader project is a command-line tool that uses the OpenAI API to extract and summarize text from PDF documents. It can extract text from multiple pages and generate a summary of the most important information in the document.

To run the PDF reader, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the pdf_reader directory.
* Install the necessary dependencies, They are available in the first cell of each notebook.
* Run the pdf_reader.py script with the path to your PDF file as an argument.

## API Key
To use the OpenAI API, you'll need to obtain an API key. You can create an account on the OpenAI website and get an API key for free. Once you have your API key, create a file named .env in the root directory of the repository and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key:

Make sure to keep your API key secret and not share it with anyone. You should also consider using environment variables or a secure key store to manage your API key.
